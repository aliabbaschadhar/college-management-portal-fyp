## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Background
Most educational institutions in Pakistan still rely on manual, paper-based academic administration — leading to attendance errors, delayed grade access, scheduling conflicts, and lack of financial transparency. The **College Management Portal** is a centralized web application built to digitize and automate these workflows.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
- Student attendance tracked on paper registers causes data loss and calculation errors.
- Students cannot access grades or attendance until end of semester.
- Manual GPA/result calculation is error-prone.
- Scheduling conflicts arise from manual timetable creation.
- No digital dues/fee transparency for students or administration.

### 1.3 Solution
A role-based, web-based platform connecting **Students**, **Faculty**, and **Admins** in a unified ecosystem. The system automates attendance, grading, timetable generation, quiz management, admissions, dues tracking, and QR-based identity verification.

### 1.4 Platform
- **Type:** Web Application (browser-based, no mobile app in this version)
- **Deployment:** Vercel (free tier)
- **Access:** Via standard browsers — Chrome, Firefox, Safari

## 2. Goals & Objectives

### 2.1 High-Level Goals
| Goal | Description |
|---|---|
| Digital Transformation | Replace all manual paper-based academic processes with digital workflows |
| Centralized Management | Single platform for students, faculty, and admins |
| Efficiency & Transparency | Automate calculations; provide real-time data access |
| Data-Driven Decision Making | Analytics dashboards with live charts and reports |
| Improved Learning Experience | Students see grades, attendance, schedules in real time |
| QR-Based Identity | Instant student profile access via QR code on student card |

---

## 3. System Architecture

The system follows a unified Next.js architecture:

```
[ Presentation Layer ]   →   Next.js (React) + ShadCN + Chart.js
        ↓
[ Application Logic ]    →   Next.js API Routes + Server Actions
        ↓
[ Data Management ]      →   PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM + Clerk Auth
```

| Frontend Framework | Next.js (App Router) | UI framework |
| UI Components | ShadCN, TailwindCSS | Pre-styled, responsive components |
| Data Visualization | Chart.js | Analytics charts and graphs |
| Backend API | Next.js API Routes | REST API endpoints & webhooks |
| Authentication | Clerk | Identity, Sign-in, User Management |
| ORM | Prisma | Database abstraction layer |
| Database | PostgreSQL | Primary data store |
| Deployment | Vercel (Free Tier) | Full-stack deployment |

## 5. User Roles

1. **Student:** End-user of academic data. Read-only profile. Can view grades, attendance, timetable, dues. Can attempt online quizzes.
2. **Faculty (Teacher):** Instructor managing classes. Marks attendance, creates quizzes, uploads marks. Cannot modify grades after Admin locks them.
3. **Admin:** Super-user with full system access. Manages users, admissions, courses, timetables, fee structures, and announcements. Can lock grades.

## 6. Functional Requirements

* **FR-01 — User Login & Authentication:** Register, log in, recover passwords securely via **Clerk**.
* **FR-02 — Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Strict access boundaries based on user role (checking Clerk publicMetadata).
* **FR-03 — Smart Attendance Tracking:** Faculty digital attendance marking, auto-calculated percentages.
* **FR-04 — Automated Timetable Generation:** Conflict-free weekly schedule generation.
* **FR-05 — Online Quiz & Question Bank:** Centralized question bank, auto-graded online quizzes.
* **FR-06 — Dues & Fee Management:** Admin manages fees, students view dues status.
* **FR-07 — Grading & Results Management:** Faculty inputs marks -> auto calculation of GPA/percentage.
* **FR-08 — Digital Admission System:** Admins process new student applications (Registration IDs & CSV imports).
* **FR-09 — Student QR Verification:** QR code scanned reveals basic public profile without login.

---

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

* **Performance:** Dashboard pages load within 2 seconds.
* **Scalability:** Handle concurrent logins during peak times.
* **Security:** Strict RBAC, HTTPS, Clerk security suite.
* **Reliability:** 100% mathematical accuracy for grades and attendance.
* **Compatibility:** Chrome, Firefox, Safari support at 720p to 1080p resolution.

---

## 8. Database Entities (PostgreSQL via Prisma)

* **User**: id, clerk_id, name, email, role. (Identity synced from Clerk)
* **Student**, **Faculty**, **Admin**: link to User by user_id.
* **Course**, **Enrollment**, **Teaches**: Manage academics and links.
* **Attendance**, **Grade**, **FeeRecord**, **TimeTable**: Academic records.
* **Quiz**, **Questions**, **QuizAttempt**: Assessments.
* **Feedback**, **Announcement**, **Admission**: Ecosystem tools.

---

## 9. API Behaviour & Business Rules

* API protected via Clerk `auth()` checks on Next API Routes.
* RBAC enforced in Next middleware and server actions.
* Arithmetic calculations for GPA, attendance auto-executed accurately.
* Timetable conflicting saves rejected with `409 Conflict`.
* Student public QR route fetches basic non-sensitive data via `/verify/:registrationId`.

## 10. Project Timeline & Cost

* Timeline: October 2025 to June 2026.
* Estimated Size: 10,500 LOC.
* Delivery milestone: Final Submission & Defense by June 19, 2026.
